# Description
Buildium is a multi-client ROBLOX launcher that includes older roblox clients.
You can host and join servers. However, it does requires IP and Port sharing.
Only play on servers you trust.

# Warnings
ONLY PLAY ON SERVERS YOU TRUST! This requires you to share your ip and port.
2007 SERVERS ARE VERY UNSTABLE! They are known to have lots of security issues.

# Hosting
Open BuildiumLauncher.bat, select the client, press 1 and ENTER.
Type the name of the map you want to play (WITHOUT THE FILE EXTENSION!)
and for the port, type in your port. The default is 53640 or 25565.

# Joining
Open BuildiumLauncher.bat, select the client, press 2 and ENTER.
Type the server IP, Port, Your playername, ID and if you want
safechat enabled. If you did this correctly, your game should
open and be connecting.

# Notes
You MUST have Visual C++ 2005 Installed if you want the 2007 clients
to load.

2012 only has solo due to the host script kicking you out after 5 seconds.
If anyone knows how to fix this, please let us know!

If you don't want to show your ip to anyone, use a tool called
RADMIN, or use Hamachi.
